# Text-to-Speech-Converter-with-GUI

This project utilizes the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to convert text input into speech output. It features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to enter text and initiate the conversion process with the click of a button. The converted speech is saved as an audio file and played using the 'afplay' command on macOS. Users can easily interact with the application to convert text to speech seamlessly.
